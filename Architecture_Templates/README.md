# üèóÔ∏è Python-Architecture-Templates  
  
This repository contains a collection of **Python scripts** that automatically generate **starter project structures** for various types of software architecture. It's designed to help developers quickly prototype or bootstrap systems using common architectural patterns.  
  
## What does this project do?  
  
- Generates directory and file structures for different architecture types.  
- Provides a quick starting point for organizing new projects.  
- Encourages clean, maintainable, and consistent architecture from day one.  
  
## Supported Architectures  
  
The following architectures are currently supported:  
  
- üß† Clean Architecture  
- üñß Client-Server  
- ‚ö° Event-Driven  
- üß© Hexagonal (Ports & Adapters)  
- üèõÔ∏è Layered  
- üß¨ Microservices  
- üß± Modular Frontend  
- üè¢ Monolithic  
- üîå Plugin-Based  
- üåê RESTful API  
- ‚òÅÔ∏è Serverless  
- üß© Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA)  
  
*> ‚ö†Ô∏è Note: The structures generated are basic templates intended as a starting point. You will need to adapt them to the specific needs of your project.*  
  
## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Usage  
  
Make sure you have **Python 3.6** or higher installed.  
  
### Architecture Template:  
  
To use an architecture template from this repository:  
  
1. Create a new Python file in your local project directory:   
   script.py  
2. Abra el archivo de arquitectura deseado de la carpeta Architecture_Templates de este repositorio y copie su contenido.  
3. Paste the content into your script.py file.  
  
### Project Name Configuration:  

The project name can be customized by editing the 'project_name' variable:  
project_name = "CustomProjectName"  
  
### Run the desired script:  
  
python **script.py**  
  
This approach lets you quickly test and adapt the architecture templates to your own needs without cloning the entire repository.
